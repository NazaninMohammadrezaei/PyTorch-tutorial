# Deep learning using PyTorch 

This repository is about practicing deep learning using Pytorch.

The codes in this Git repository are what I have learned from the well-known YouTube channel by Harrison Kinsley known as `Sentdex` .

Make sure to visit his channel and specifically his compact PyTorch series:[Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdeMyHEYc0gxFpYwHY2Qfdh)

File names are representative enough, but here is a little explanation:

`01 Introduction` : It introduces tensors and their features

`02 Training data` : It trains a shallow neural network without convolution layers on MNIST dataset (Images of digits from 0-9)

`03 Deep Convolutional Neural Network` : training a deep convolutional neural network to classify images of cats and dogs
